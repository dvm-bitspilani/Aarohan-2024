                words="I participated in the Aarohan competition at BITS, Pilani in 2024. What impressed me most was the format - it was both challenging and unique, which made it a truly engaging experience. The competition also provided great exposure to BITS Pilani. The Apogee fest is also great with a multitude of events and lectures taking place. I even made some new friends and learned a lot from the experience. Aarohan was a rewarding competition that pushed my limits and helped me grow as a participant. Aarohan not only allowed me to showcase my abilities but also opened doors to new opportunities and connections. It was an unforgettable experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking to challenge themselves, achieve recognition, and immerse themselves in a top-tier college festival environment."

One thing remains, the experience of Aarohan Round 2 is very special and memorable. "
