    <meta name="description" content="Aarohan is a national-level olympiad organized by the students of BITS Pilani to inspire scientific curiosity in young minds. We believe that intelligence, creativity and problem-solving ability are associated with inquisitiveness. Our aim is to foster critical analysis skills and encourage their natural curiosity through this endeavor.  Aarohan has grown rapidly since 2012. What started off as a small idea has now blossomed into a big event across the nation. We have made an impact internationally with participation from Abu Dhabi and Germany.">
